						<p class="w3lstext">
							YouTube has made it extremely easy to watch videos from anywhere, at any time. However, one major disadvantage is that you need a really good internet connection at all times to be able to watch videos. If there are specific videos, music videos or podcasts that you would like to be able to watch without an internet connection, it can be hard to find easy to download files off the internet outside of YouTube. This is where YouTube video converters come in.
							<br><br>
							YouTube converters are a type of software that helps convert videos off YouTube into your phone and enable you to store them as MP3 (Audio only), MP4, or 3GP. Often, the best video converter softwares out there will take most of the guesswork out of what quality of videos you should download, and what each of the acronyms mean. Which means you don’t have to wonder if 3GP will bring you audio only, or give you the full multimedia audio and video experience.
							<br><br>
							This software can be great for travellers who want to watch travel videos in another place or country without incurring ridiculous charges for accessing the internet. It can also be great for aspiring musicians who want to learn to play different tracks, but don’t want to incur charges for rewinding and replaying the same video multiple times. In addition, it can also be great for those hard-to-find songs or covers of songs you want to transfer to your music player to listen at your convenience, instead of having to open YouTuvbe every time.
							<br><br>
							These YouTube video converters can convert videos in 4K quality - you cna save the file as video format in MP4, MKV and 3GP formats, or in audio formats in MP3, M4A, WMV, AVI and OGG. They will also give you options in the video resolutions that you need, from 144P, 240P, 360P, 480P, 720P or even 1080P Full HD. You can also set entire playlists to download when you get access to good internet, and the software will do the rest.<br><br>
